README
======

This project was created as a hobby in order to have a stable and modern SNES emulator for iOS that could be compiled straight from Xcode for the benefit of developers with valid development certificates.

Previously available emulators were either only available on Cydia (which requires being jailbroken) or simply didn't run well when "home built" due to a much outdated SNES9X codebase or messy iOS implementation. In fact, this project started as a Xcode-compatible port of ZodTTD's snes4iphone and has been since rewritten beyond recognition.


Features:
=========

- SNES9X 1.53 codebase;
- SMC and ZIP support;
- Easy to understand UI;
- Automatic state saving/resuming, so you can quit and automatically return to the latest place you were;
- Manual state saving/resuming in another slot;
- Optional Auto-frameskip.


How to submit new iCade controller variants:
============================================

- Pair your bluetooth controller with the iOS device;
- Make sure your device's keyboard layout is set to US (QWERTY);
- Open Notes;
- Enter the following button sequence matching, as best as you can, the SNES button layout: Up, Right, Down, Left, Select, Start, Y, B, X, A, L, R;
- Copy the text generated (there should be 24 letters) and send it over to me with the correct controller name or comment on the controller tracking issue on GitHub.


How to build:
=============

- Download the source code;
- Open the SiOS.xcodeproj in Xcode (version 4.2 was used in this project);
- Change the "Code Signing Identity" under "Build Settings" to your own;
- Choose your device in the Scheme selector;
- "Product" > "Profile" will deploy a Release build with all the optimizations available.
- Drop your ROMs into the app in iTunes and just run it.


Remarks:
========

Since this project is based on SNES9X 1.53 code which is mostly C++, it is slower than some other emulators, like SNES4iOS or SNES4ALL, which have parts of them in ASM from SNES9X 1.39. However, the 1.53 codebase has higher ROM compatibility. For instance, this emulator runs perfect on an iPad 2, but requires a frameskip of 1 for most games on an iPad 1 and frameskip of 2 for most games on an iPhone 4.
